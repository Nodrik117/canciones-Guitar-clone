loading_phrase = This song was made specifically for the American Dad episode "A Starboy Is Born", which is Season 15, Episode 4. The Weeknd is actually a devoted fan of American Dad, and not only did he make a guest appearance in this episode, he also co-wrote the entire episode. In an interview with Variety, The Weeknd said "I always wanted to play a character that was the opposite of the public’s perception of me — and of course make fun of myself. Once I was given the opportunity I took complete advantage." <br> Bravo, Abel. Bravo. </br>
