loading_phrase = To craft a door in Minecraft you have to place 6 wooden planks of any variety arranged in the shape of a door in a crafting bench. You can make a door in any of the variants of wood in the game, including but not limited to, oak, spruce, and acacia. Now that you have this knowledge, you must go forth and conquer the known realms of the universe. Now go, minion, pickaxe in hand, and find your nearest tree to punch.
